            <h4><i>Summer 2021; Northwestern CIERA REU; Advisors: Prof. Wen-fai Fong and Dr. Kerry Paterson</i></h4>
            <p>Description coming soon!</p><br>
            <!--<p>With an established interest in observational astronomy, I was thrilled to join Prof. Wen-fai Fong‚Äôs group through the NSF REU at Northwestern University in the summer of 2021, developing software that would aid us in the search for electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) events. The EM counterparts in question, kilonovae (KNe), are rapidly dimming transients that follow the mergers of neutron stars and/or black hole, which produce gravitational waves. These elusive transients are hard to catch (their optical signals vanish within hours to a day), but the physics insights they unlock are worth the chase. In acquiring and analyzing EM and GW observations from a single source, which has only been done for one KN to date, we can answer questions about the equation of state of nuclear matter [1] and measure the present value of the Hubble constant [2]. My goal was to integrate a second telescope, the 90-inch Bok telescope on Kitt Peak, into my team‚Äôs network to increase the chances of observing an EM counterpart when following up on GW detections. With this additional telescope, we are able to probe fainter and farther sources and scan a larger area of the sky within the short window of time the KN would be observable. To accomplish this, I wrote Python code to process the new telescope‚Äôs data and prepare it for the first step in our KN candidate vetting process, image subtraction. I also tested the performance of our image subtraction software to ensure that a real KN would be identified by our pipeline when analyzing data from Bok. I strengthened my Python skills by facing and conquering technical data reduction challenges: unlike my previous project, where I analyzed tidy and pre-processed DES data, I developed code that turned raw telescope images into science-ready data. By the end of the REU, I merged my code into my team‚Äôs pipeline, setting us up for success in the currently ongoing fourth observing run for GWs by LIGO. I presented this work at the 240th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), and I am an author of an Astrophysical Journal publication (Rastinejad et al. incl. Hall 2022) and a working paper about our team‚Äôs infrastructure (Hosseinzadeh et al. incl. Hall 2023, on arXiv).</p>-->

            <h3><b>Animating Trans-Neptunian Objects</b></h3>
            <h4><i>2020-2021; UPenn; Advisor: Prof. Gary Bernstein</i></h4>
            <p>In my first research project, I embarked on a data visualization project with the goal of creating a comprehensive ‚Äúmovie‚Äù about the icy bodies that orbit our Sun at distances beyond Neptune, known as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). At that point, the 800+ TNOs existed primarily as data in a table and had never been visualized at large scales or as an entire set. Transforming flat lines of code into animations, my work offered a never-before-seen view of TNOs moving through the solar system over thousands of years. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvvT83fOsZFFLZAjzRSu_4jgXGgt8_De/view">Here</a> is a copy of our first "movie script."

            And here is the movie itself (embedded below)!! <div style="padding:28.125% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/662683536?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:50%;height:100%;" title="TNOs"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
            </p>

            <p>To uncover these insights, I wrote Python code that compiled thousands of Matplotlib frames into animations of TNO detections and orbits. Through this project, I realized the discovery potential of large sky surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES), which was the source of these TNO detections, and the importance of building fast and effective algorithms in the era of big-data astronomy. I presented this movie at a DES transients working group meeting, a collaboration-wide DES video conference, and to an audience of scientists and non-scientists alike at the conclusion of a thesis defense of the student who originally compiled this data: Pedro Bernardinelli.</p>
            <!--Here are some reactions from the Zoom chat: [...]</p>-->

            <p>This was the perfect first project for me - it was a crash course in Python data visualization (I had no coding experience at the time), and a beautiful mix of astronomy and art (Prof. Bernstein came up with the project knowing that I was working as a Video Editor at the time)! If you're really interested, I documented my progress in <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3mbOhQGHzna5hEchEonmudQ1m8mH_Ij/view>this lab journal</a> as part of Penn's P&A Undergraduate Summer Research Academy. (I feel like it's a bit of time capsule for what my life was like in the covid-era as a newbie researcher.) </p>
